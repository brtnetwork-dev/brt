- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brt.git
   cd brt
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Desktop app
   cd desktop
   npm install

   # Dashboard
   cd ../dashboard
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Project Structure

- `desktop/` - Electron desktop application
- `dashboard/` - Next.js web dashboard
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript types

## Development Workflow

### Desktop Application

1. Start development server:
   ```bash
   cd desktop
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Make your changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Build to verify:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Dashboard

1. Set up environment variables (see dashboard/README.md)
2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Make your changes
4. Test locally
5. Build to verify:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript (`strict: true`)
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use TypeScript for prop types

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add semicolons
- Use trailing commas in multiline objects/arrays
- Run ESLint and Prettier before committing

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(desktop): add pause mining button

fix(dashboard): correct leaderboard sorting

docs(readme): update installation instructions

refactor(api): simplify points calculation logic
```

### Commit Best Practices

- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues in commits when applicable
- Keep commits focused and small

## Pull Request Process
